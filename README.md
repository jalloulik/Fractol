Sidenote : The choice of colors is not something I would compliment myself on.

## What it is about

This was a school project at 42Born2Code, as well as our first computer graphic project that had us calculate each pixel color independently from each other.

#### List of Fractals :
- Manderlbrot
- Julia
- Manderlbrot 3

#### Features :
- While on Julia fractol, pressing "t" toggles on and off Julia constant editing, which makes the fractal change by moving the mouse
- Can zoom in forever (it will start looking pixelated eventually when you get close the double limits)
- Can change the color palette
- Can modify the number of max iterations which would make for a more or less accurate fractal
